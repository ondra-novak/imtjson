 * Reference to value. It acts like ordinary Value, in exception you can actually assign a value to it.
 * The objects remembers the source of the value, and assigning to the variable causes, that original
 * variable is modified, like an ordinary reference supose to work. However, this object allows to
 * make a reference to a member variable of a container - object or array. Setting the value to the reference
 * also overwrites the value in the source container.
 *
 * This feature doesn't break immutability, because you cannot modify containers stored as the Value. Only
 * containers stored as the Object or the Array can create reference.
 *
 * Similar to common reference, the reference remains valid as long as source value is valid. Accessing
 * the reference after destroying the source container causes undefined behavoir or crash.
 *
 * Unlike to common reference, content of this reference is not synced with other references created from
 * the same source. For implementation reason, the ValueRef objects keeps copy of the value for fast
 * access. The copy is updated everytime the value is modified throught the reference object, but not in
 * situation, when the source is modified by another way. If you need to have fresh copy of the source value,
 * you need to manually call the function sync()
 *
